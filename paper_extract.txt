Numerical methods for contact mechanics are of great importance in engineering applications,
enabling the prediction and analysis of complex surface interactions under various conditions.
In this work, we propose an energy-based physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework
for solving frictionless contact problems under large deformation. Inspired by microscopic
Lennard-Jones potential, a surface contact energy is used to describe the contact phenomena.
To ensure the robustness of the proposed PINN framework, relaxation, gradual loading and
output scaling techniques are introduced. In the numerical examples, the well-known Hertz
contact benchmark problem is conducted, demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of
the proposed PINN framework. Moreover, challenging contact problems with the consideration
of geometrical and material nonlinearities are tested. It has been shown that the proposed
PINN framework provides a reliable and powerful tool for nonlinear contact mechanics. More
importantly, the proposed PINN framework exhibits competitive computational efficiency to the
commercial FEM software when dealing with those complex contact problems. The codes used
in this manuscript are available at https://github.com/JinshuaiBai/energy_PINN_Contact.
1. Introduction
Contact and interaction between objects are ubiquitous in nature and industrial production. Accurately simulating the deforma-
tion of bodies during contact is crucial for understanding and predicting mechanical behaviour. Contact problems are inherently
nonlinear and are a fundamental aspect of solid mechanics [1]. Over the years, significant efforts have been dedicated to addressing
these problems, with mesh-based methods emerging as a predominant approach [2–5]. Additionally, meshless methods, employing
both weak and strong formulations, have been proposed to tackle challenges in contact mechanics [6–10].
The complexities of contact mechanics, such as contact discretisation and boundary smoothness, make it a particularly
challenging area of study [11]. To overcome these challenges, isogeometric analysis (IGA) frameworks based on non-uniform rational
B-splines (NURBS) have been developed. These frameworks enable exact representations of complex geometries and provide superior
continuity properties [12–16]. Beyond issues of contact smoothness and discretisation, the enforcement of inequality constraints

represents another critical aspect of contact mechanics. Various numerical techniques, such as the Lagrange multiplier method, the
augmented Lagrangian formulation, and mortar methods, have been extensively developed to address this issue [17,18].
In recent years, a novel kind of deep learning (DL) framework [19,20], namely the physics-informed neural networks (PINNs),
has merged as a powerful and promising tool for solving partial differential equations [21–24], and therefore attracted significant
attention in the computational mechanics [25–28]. Numerous numbers of PINN-based computational solid mechanics frameworks
have been proposed [29–32]. Among those frameworks, neural networks regulated by the energy form loss provide the most robust
results with favourable efficiency. Those energy-based PINN frameworks are also known as the deep energy method (DEM) [31].
Great performances of those PINN frameworks have been witnessed in a variety of applications, including linear elasticity [31,33],
hyperelasticity [34], elastoplasticity [35,36], fracture [37–39], large deformation problems [40], and topology optimisation [41–
44]. Besides, adaptive sampling strategies [45,46] have been proposed to avoid the overfitting issue and enhance the accuracy of
predictions. In addition, traditional PDE solving techniques have been introduced to the energy-based PINN frameworks, ending up
with establishing novel methods for solid mechanics challenges. For example, complementary energy form and boundary integration
form lead to novel deep complementary energy method [47] and boundary-informed neural network frameworks [48], respectively.
Novel neural network structures are also implemented. Bai et al. [40] applied radial basis networks to deal with problems
involving both material and geometrical nonlinearity. It has been demonstrated that such a framework can easily capture instability
phenomena and is locking-free when modelling nearly incompressible materials. Wang et al. [49] implement the Kolmogorov
Arnold network (KAN) with physics knowledge. By doing so, the KAN shows exceptional performances for multi-scale and material
discontinuity problems.
Despite its notable success in computational mechanics, only limited exploration regarding PINNs has been conducted on
contact problems. Sahin et al. [50] proposed a PINN framework under the strong form formulation with the classical Karush–
Kuhn–Tucker constraint to solve the forward and inverse contact problems. Efforts have also been directed towards addressing
interfacial discontinuities arising from the consideration of multi-material systems [51]. However, in those existing and limited
literature, either small deformation problems are discussed or the contact surfaces remain unchanged throughout the training,
e.g., neither new contact area generated nor sliding between contact surfaces is considered. It has been demonstrated that the
PINN framework is very effective for material nonlinearities and large deformation problems [34,40]. Besides, the energy-based
PINNs are computationally more efficient and robust than the vanilla PINNs [32]. Therefore, it is of great interest to implement
energy-based PINNs to solve contact problems. Moreover, the effectiveness and performance of the energy-based PINNs for contact
problems with complex nonlinearities are also worth investigating.
To address this research gap, in this work, we propose an energy-based PINN framework for contact problems with both
material and geometrical nonlinearities. The contact behaviour is described by a contact potential and together optimised by
gradient descendant algorithms. Moreover, additional numerical treatments, including the relaxation, gradual loading and output
scaling are also introduced to improve the robustness of the proposed framework. The Hertz contact benchmark problems under
small deformation assumption are examined to show the performances of the proposed framework. More importantly, various
contact examples considering both the material and the geometrical nonlinearities are tested, including the rubber ironing, the
rubber ring contact instability and the compression of two rings. The deformed configurations and stress contours demonstrate the
effectiveness and substantial potential of the proposed PINN framework for complex nonlinear mechanics. Notably, the proposed
framework is very straightforward to implement numerically and can easily incorporate experimental data. Additionally, the PINN
framework demonstrates competitive computational efficiency compared to commercial FEM software when addressing complex
contact problems.
The remainder of the paper is organised as follows: In Section 2, the basic conceptions of energy-based PINN for solid mechanics
are briefly introduced. In Section 3, the frictionless contact achieved by using the surface potential and its implementation based
on the PINN framework are proposed. The Hertz contact benchmark problem is also examined and discussed in detail. In Section 4,
numerical examples involving large deformation and material nonlinearities are presented, including the rubber ironing, the rubber
ring contact instability and the compression of two rings. In Section 5, the conclusions of this work are summarised.
2. Energy-based PINN for nonlinear solid mechanics
2.1. Loss function informed by potential energy
We first recap the basic conceptions of the energy-based PINN in solid mechanics. In this method, neural networks are used to
approximate the admissible displacement solution 𝒖(𝒙) satisfying the essential boundary condition:
𝒖(𝒙) ≈ 𝑭(𝒙; 𝜽)
𝒖(𝒙) = ̄𝒖(𝒙), 𝒙∈ 𝛤𝒖 (1)
where 𝑭(⋅) denotes a neural network mapping and 𝜽denotes the trainable parameters in the network. ̄𝒖(𝒙) is the prescribed essential
boundary conditions on essential boundary 𝛤𝒖. Note that the neural network structure has been introduced in many PINN-based
computational mechanics literature, and different types of neural networks can be found in [52–54]. Referring to the principle
of minimum potential energy, the solution to the solid mechanics problem can be obtained by finding a 𝒖(𝒙) that minimises the
potential energy of the solid system
𝒖(𝒙) = ar g min
𝒖(𝒙)
𝛱(𝒖(𝒙)), (2)
Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering 437 (2025) 117787

J. Bai et al.
where 𝛱(⋅) is the overall potential energy functional and can be calculated by
𝛱 = 𝐸in − 𝐸ex, (3)
where 𝐸in and 𝐸ex are the strain energy and the potential energy of external forces, respectively. For elastic material, the strain
energy can be calculated by
𝐸in = ∫𝛺
𝛹(𝑭)d𝛺 , (4)
where 𝛹(⋅) and 𝑭 are the strain energy density and deformation gradient tensor, respectively [55]. The potential energy of external
forces can be obtained by
𝐸ex = ∫𝛤𝒕
̄𝒕⋅ 𝒖d𝛤 , (5)
where ̄𝒕is the given traction force on the natural boundary 𝛤𝒕. Many weak-form computational mechanics methods are established
based on the principle of minimum potential energy, such as FEM, element free Galerkin (EFG) method [56] and point interpolation
method (PIM) [57]. They are considered to be more stable than those based on the strong form formulation, and PINN-based
computational mechanics frameworks are no exception [58]. It has been reported that energy-based PINNs are computationally
more efficient and better at capturing the stress concentration [33,58].
2.2. Boundary condition imposition
As mentioned above, the natural (traction) boundary conditions are already embedded in the potential energy. Auxiliary
techniques are required to impose the essential boundary conditions. Consider the essential boundary condition is defined on 𝛤𝒖
𝒖(𝒙) = ̄𝒖(𝒙), 𝒙∈ 𝛤𝒖 (6)
where ̄𝒖(𝒙) is the prescribed essential boundary conditions on 𝛤𝒖. Currently, the essential boundary conditions in energy-based
PINNs can be imposed in soft or hard manners.
The so-called ‘‘soft’’ boundary condition imposition technique in PINNs is also known as the penalty method [59]. It produces
solutions that approximately satisfy essential boundary conditions. To implement it, a least-square functional, 𝛱EBC, is first
formulated
𝛱EBC = ∫𝛤𝑢
‖𝒖(𝒙) − ̄𝒖(𝒙)‖2
2d𝛤 = ∫𝛤𝑢
([𝒖(𝒙) − ̄𝒖(𝒙)] ⋅ [𝒖(𝒙) − ̄𝒖(𝒙)]) d𝛤 , (7)
where ‖ ⋅ ‖2 is the 2-norm on the essential boundary. As observed, 𝛱EBC only reaches its minimal value when the predicted
displacements exactly equal the given boundary conditions. It is then added to the overall potential energy functional with a penalty
factor 𝜅
𝛱∗ = 𝛱+ 𝜅 𝛱EBC. (8)
where 𝛱∗ is the modified energy functional. Referring to the penalty method, 𝜅 should be a positive factor. With increasing 𝜅,
the solution obtained by Eq. (8) will recover to the solution of the original problem. In numerical implementation, residuals are
inevitable on the essential boundaries, such penalty method is therefore called the soft boundary condition imposition technique.
To impose the essential boundary conditions in the ‘‘hard’’ way, the neural network output is tailored so that it can naturally
satisfy the essential boundary conditions
𝒖(𝒙) = 𝑭(𝒙) ⊙𝒈(𝒙) + ̄𝒖(𝒙), (9)
where ⊙ is the element-wise product, and the distance network 𝒈(𝒙) represents the shortest distance from a given point 𝒙 to the
essential boundary:
𝒈(𝒙) = min
𝒚∈𝛤𝑢
√
‖𝒙− 𝒚‖2
2 = min
𝒚∈𝛤𝑢
√
(𝒙− 𝒚) ⋅ (𝒙− 𝒚). (10)
There are two main advantages of using the hard boundary condition imposition technique. First, the essential boundary
condition can be exactly imposed. Second, the physics-informed loss function can include fewer loss terms. The neural network
training can be regarded as a multi-task learning process if multiple loss terms exist in the final loss function. Using too many loss
terms may induce the imbalance training issue, and thus hyperparameters are required to balance the residuals from different loss
terms [29]. Tuning hyperparameters before each loss term can be annoying. For simple geometries, the explicit form of 𝒈(𝒙) can
be obtained. For complex boundary geometries, the distance function can be constructed in replacement of 𝒈(𝒙). For more details,
please refer to [60].
In this study, the hard boundary condition enforcement technique is directly utilised to fixed boundary conditions. For
displacement loading, the soft boundary condition enforcement is initially applied, followed by the use of the hard boundary
condition technique.

modulus and the Poisson’s ratio are 1 × 104 Pa and 0.3, respectively. The left boundary of the beam is fixed. A parabolic distributed force of 10 𝑁 is downwardly
applied on the right boundary. Two feedforward neural networks with 3 hidden layers and 5 neurons per layer are used for predicting displacements. When
using gradient descendant algorithms, the overall potential energy decreases during the training of energy-based PINNs. The intermediate absolute displacement
mappings are shown. Along with the decreasing energy functional, the beam seems to be dynamically bent to the equilibrium state. Note that the VGD in the
figure refers to the vanilla gradient descendant algorithm. A learning rate of 1 × 10−4 is applied. (b) Comparisons between 𝜂𝜕𝒖

𝜕 𝑡 and actual displacement increment when using the ADAM optimiser at the 20000th

2.3. Neural network training and its pseudo-dynamic nature
To solve the problem, optimisers are applied to minimise the loss function by iteratively adjusting those trainable parameters, 𝜽.
Among all, gradient descendant optimisers have earned great favour due to their effectiveness and efficiency. Currently, the ADAM
optimiser is the most popular optimiser in PINN training [61]. In the energy-based PINNs, the energy functional at a given set of
displacement mappings is treated as the loss function. Therefore, the training of the energy-based PINN can be regarded as a way to
dissipate the overall potential energy. In other words, the energy-based PINNs are trained in a pseudo-dynamic manner. This can be
verified by the example shown in Fig. 1(a), where both the vanilla gradient descendant (VGD) algorithm and the ADAM optimiser are
applied to train neural networks for a 2D cantilever beam problem. After initialisation, neural networks map to random displacement
fields. During the training, with the decreasing of the potential energy functional, the intermediate displacement mappings are
shown. Along with the decreasing energy functional, the beam seems to be dynamically bent to the equilibrium state. Eventually,
the functional loss stably converges around 2 × 104 epochs. Meanwhile, it can be noticed that the bending rates of the beam vary from
the use of different optimisers. The ADAM optimiser incorporates the momentum of the gradient information. Hence, it can adjust
the learning rate of each trainable parameter. By so doing, the use of the ADAM optimiser can significantly avoid loss oscillations
during training and enhance the training robustness.

If gradient descendant algorithms are selected, the pseudo-velocity of the displacement mappings by neural networks during
training can be approximately calculated by
𝜕 𝑢
𝜕 𝑡 ≈ − 𝜕 𝐹(𝒙; 𝜽)T
𝜕𝜽
𝜕 𝛱
𝜕𝜽, (11)
where 𝐹(𝒙; 𝜽) is the neural network displacement mapping, as presented in Eq. (1). Moreover, the increment of displacement can
obtained by
𝛥𝑢≈ 𝜂𝜕 𝑢
𝜕 𝑡. (12)
The derivation is given in Appendix A. These equations can be further verified by Fig. 1(b) and (c). As observed, the pseudo-velocity
can effectively predict the displacement increment during training when the VGD algorithm is selected. Although small departures
can be observed when using the ADAM optimiser, the overall pseudo-velocity is quite similar to the displacement increment after
the energy loss is stabilised. It should be noted that the pseudo-dynamics nature exhibited by neural network training is not identical
to second-order ordinary differential systems. In addition, the VGD converges faster at the beginning of the training. However, for
complex nonlinear problems, the VGD may trapped in local optima, while the ADAM optimiser can provide more reliable predictions
(see Appendix B). We highlight that the pseudo-dynamics nature of the energy-based PINN can be utilised as a gradual loading
process till the equilibrium state, equivalent to the iterative solvers in the traditional methods when dealing with nonlinear problems.
Besides, the pseudo-velocity can help properly select the learning rate so that no penetration will happen during the training process.
Those numerical techniques are explained in the following section.
3. Frictionless contact potentials and numerical implementations
3.1. Frictionless surface contact potential
In general contact problems, consider two bodies are getting close to each other, as shown in Fig. 2(a). From the microscopic
point of view, it is the molecular and atom forces between two bodies that prevent them from penetrating each other. Such repulsive
phenomenon is usually described by potentials, for example, the well-known Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential [62], as presented in
Fig. 3(a). Therefore, bringing this idea to the macroscale, a penalty-liked surface contact potential can be used to mimic the
microscopic LJ potential between molecules and atoms. In this case, the overall potential energy of the conservation system can be
re-written as
𝛱 = 𝐸in − 𝐸ex + 𝐸c, (13)
where 𝐸c is the surface contact potential energy and can be obtained by [63]
𝐸c = ∫𝛤1 ∫𝛤2
𝛽1𝛽2𝜙(𝑟)d𝛤1d𝛤2, (14)
where 𝜙 and 𝑟 are the surface contact potential and the relative distance between contact surfaces, respectively. 𝛽 is the surface
density. The subscribes 1 and 2 denote the two contact surfaces. As observed, surface integrations are done on both surfaces of
bodies. It is clear to find that the LJ potential is not a monotonic function, where it goes down first and then increases sharply when
𝑟→ 0. Nevertheless, given that this non-monotonic area only appears when the distance between the atom and molecular is close
enough, which generally does not appear in the macroscopic contact problems. Therefore, a monotonic function can be applied as
the surface contact potential, as long as the macroscopic potential increases steeply when 𝑟 → 0 and decays fastly when 𝑟 → ∞.
Here, an exponential form potential is applied in this work and defined as
𝜙(𝑟) = 𝜙0 exp
(
− 𝑟
𝑟0
)
, (15)
where 𝜙0 and 𝑟0 are the pre-defined potential constant and the effective radius of the discrete points, respectively. The plot of the
repulsive potential is given in Fig. 3(b). Therefore, the corresponding contact force can be calculated by
𝑭c = ∫𝛤1 ∫𝛤2

(16)
It is worth noting that the idea of using the surface potential for contact problems has been implemented in [63]. Besides, the rigorous
derivations regarding the contact forces and variational formulation have been discussed in detail. However, in the framework of
the proposed energy-based PINN, the potential energy functional is directly used and is minimised by powerful neural network
optimisers. Meanwhile, we note that contact potentials can be in different forms and not necessarily identical to Eq. (15). Other
contact potentials can be selected according to different contact problems. More contact potentials can be found in [63]. This work
will only focus on demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed PINN framework for contact problems. Therefore, only one contact
potential is tested in the following numerical examples.

To numerically obtain the surface contact potential energy, sample points are placed to the possible contact area on both surfaces
of the two bodies. In this work, this kind of contact model is called the point-to-point (PP) model, as shown in Fig. 2(a). Such kind
of contact model can generally apply to different irregular geometries.
For some cases where regular geometry is used, as shown in Fig. 2(b). In these scenarios, only discrete sample points are placed
on the irregular surface. In this work, we call this kind of contact model the point-to-surface (PS) model. Therefore, the surface
contact potential energy of the PS contact model can be simplified as
𝐸c = ∫𝛤1
𝛽1𝜙(𝑟)d𝛤1, (17)
where 𝑟 is always perpendicular to the surface of the regular surface. Such a PS model is less generalised but can greatly improve
both computational efficiency and accuracy. In the following numerical examples, both the PP and the PS models are applied to
deal with different contact scenarios. More detailed discussions between those two contact models are available in Section 3.4.
It is worth noting that, such contact potential can also be used to describe the frictional contact phenomenon. However, in this
work, we only use this potential to deal with frictionless contact problems. The friction force is a non-conservative force. Hence,
frictional contact problems will be covered in our future work.
3.2. Numerical implementation
As shown in Eq. (15), the distances between the contact boundary nodes are necessary. Here, all the formulas are based on 2D
problems and they can be easily extended to 3D scenarios. Consider the numbers of contact points on the potential contact surfaces
are 𝑛 and 𝑚, respectively. The relative distance between contact points can be stored in a matrix of size 𝑛× 𝑚
𝑟𝑛×𝑚 =
√
(𝛥𝒖)2 + (𝛥𝒗)2, (18)
where
𝛥𝒖𝑛×𝑚 = 𝒙𝑛×1 ⊗𝟏𝑚×1 − (𝒙𝑚×1 ⊗𝟏𝑛×1)T
𝛥𝒗𝑛×𝑚 = 𝒚𝑛×1 ⊗𝟏𝑚×1 − (𝒚𝑚×1 ⊗𝟏𝑛×1)T (19)
where 𝟏 is the vector of ones, and the notation ⊗ denotes the outer product. In Python, the outer product can be directly used as
the multiplication by TensorFlow2. Therefore, the potential between each pair of points can be calculated as
𝜙(𝑟)𝑛×𝑚 = 𝜙0 exp
(
− 𝑟𝑛×𝑚
𝑟0
)
. (20)
This equation is then substituted into Eq. (14) to calculate the overall contact potential. We note that the above implementation is
compatible with the automatic differentiation technique. Thus, the contact energy added to the final loss can be directly minimised
by neural network optimisers. The overall PINN framework proposed for contact problems is shown in Fig. 4.
3.3. Relaxation, gradual loading and output scaling
After initialising neural networks, the displacement mappings were established. However, those randomly built-up mappings
may cause the multiple bodies to overlap with each other, as the example shown in Fig. 5(a–e). Therefore, to avoid the overlapping
issue, relaxation can be applied first before solving problems. In relaxation, the contact potential is not activated in the loss function.
In this manner, the neural network displacement mappings will be trained to dissipate the overall potential energy, and eventually
reach their undeformed states, as shown in Fig. 5(f).
As mentioned in Section 2.3, neural network training has a pseudo-dynamics nature. If the increment of one training epoch
goes too far, the contact bodies may penetrate each other. To address this problem, the learning rate of training should be properly
selected based on the pseudo-velocity assessed by Eq. (11). Moreover, since the soft boundary condition imposition technique is
applied for the moving boundary conditions, a gradual loading formula can be applied to circumvent the body penetration
𝛱EBC(𝑡) = 1
𝑛
∑
‖𝒖(𝒙) − 𝑡
𝑡max
̄𝒖(𝒙)‖2
2, (21)
where 𝑡 is the current training epoch and 𝑡max is the maximum training epoch, 𝑛 is the number of sample points on the essential
boundary. As such, the soft boundary condition is gradually imposed through the training loop. We also highlight that, when the
displacement boundary condition is roughly fulfilled with a small residual and the contact system is stabilised, the hard boundary
imposition techniques can be then utilised instead.
In general, the initialising schemes for neural networks are likely to confine the initial output of neural networks within the
range of [−1,1]. Furthermore, given that bias is typically not assigned to the final hidden layer in neural networks, the significant
responsibility for scaling the output value is placed on the weights of this layer when solely the tanh activation function is employed.
Hence, when the displacement fields only have small deformation, the training of neural networks will be very difficult and
time-consuming. To address this problem, the output scaling factors are added to the established neural network mapping (Eq. (9))
𝑢(𝒙) = 𝜉(𝑭(𝒙) ⊙𝒈(𝒙) + ̄𝒖(𝒙)), (22)
where 𝜉 is the pre-defined scaling factor. The output scaling is used in the following benchmark problems (the Hertz contact
problems).

3.4. Benchmark tests and discussions
Using the aforementioned framework, the 2D Hertz contact problem is analysed. The problem is under the assumption of small
deformation. A half cylinder is compressed on a rigid horizontal plane, as shown in Fig. 6(a). A uniform pressure of 𝐹 = 0.5 N/m
is subjected to be top of the half cylinder. A linear elastic material is considered, where Young’s modulus 𝐸 = 200 Pa and Poisson’s

respectively. For each case, neural networks are trained 5 times and each training converges by 5 × 103 epochs.

ratio 𝜈= 0.3. The analytical solution is obtained from [64]. To solve this problem, two FNNs are built up to predict the displacements
𝑈 and 𝑉, respectively. Each network contains 3 hidden layers and 30 neurons per layer. The scaling factor is 𝜉 = 1 × 10−3. Thus,
the 𝑈 and 𝑉 outputs of neural networks are obtained by
𝑈 = 𝜉 𝑥𝐹𝑥(𝑥, 𝑦),
𝑉 = 𝜉 𝐹𝑦(𝑥, 𝑦),
(23)
where the hard boundary condition is applied to the 𝑈 prediction.
The sample points distribution is shown in Fig. 6(b). In this work, the sample points inside the computational domain are
generated following the Gaussian quadrature. Since the contact area is located at the bottom of the cylinder, refined sample points
are applied near the contact area, as shown in Fig. 6(c). The ADAM optimiser is selected with a learning rate of 1 × 10−4. For each
case, neural networks are trained 5 times and each training converges by 2 × 103 epochs. Both the point–plane and point-point
contact models are tested.
Fig. 6(d) shows the results produced by the PINN-based framework and the FEM. Fig. 6(e) further shows the absolute error
contours of displacement fields of the proposed PINN frameworks. The mean absolute error of the predicted 𝑈 and 𝑉 fields by
using the PP model are respectively 3.89 × 10−6 N/m2 and 2.15 × 10−4 N/m2, while those of the PS model are respectively 4.36 × 10−6
N/m2 and 1.28 × 10−4 N/m2. All predicted contours are in good agreement with the reference results. Fig. 6(f) and (g) plots the
contact pressure obtained by the PINN-based framework and Table 1 lists the mean relative percentage errors of PINN predictions
with different contact models. The discussion starts with using different 𝑟0 while a fixed 𝜙0 of 1 × 104 is applied. We note that 𝑟0
here also controls the spacing of the contact sample points on the contact area, in other words, a decreasing 𝑟0 will induce more
contact points on the same length of a contact boundary. With decreasing selections of 𝑟0, the predicted contact pressure fits the
analytical solution better, especially near the area of the transition point from contact to the free surface, as shown in Fig. 6(e). It
is rational since it should converge to the analytical solution with decreasing selection of 𝑟0, analogous to the real atom model used
in molecular dynamics. When changing the value of 𝜙0 and fixing 𝑟0 = 1 × 10−5 m, it is found that the accuracy of the results is not
very sensitive to different 𝜙0, as shown in Fig. 6(f). It is also worth noting that, when using the PP contact model, the cylinder can
penetrate the substrate plane if too small 𝜙0 is selected. Notably, 𝜙0 is similar to the penalty factors in the penalty method when
imposing the essential boundary conditions. Moreover, it can be found that the framework with the PS model can achieve greater
accuracy. Despite the relatively large discrepancy, the framework with the PP contact model is still effective enough to accurately
capture the stress concentration patterns near the contact area, as presented in Fig. 6(d). Therefore, for irregular contact surfaces,
the PP contact model is used instead of the PS contact model.
Finally, Table 2 presents the computational accuracy and efficiency of the energy-based PINNs with respect to different neural
network sizes. With increasing numbers of layers and neurons per layer, neural networks can provide more accurate contact
pressure predictions. However, the computational efficiency decreases due to the increasing number of trainable parameters in
larger networks. Notably, training networks of the 3 × 20 size costs more time than larger networks. This is because a GPU is
used. The GPU spends more time in accessing data rather than calculations. The computational efficiency should be increased with
decreasing size of networks if a CPU is used.
4. Numerical examples
Herein, three frictionless contact problems with material and geometric nonlinearities are conducted to test the performance of
the proposed framework. In all cases, the hyperelastic Neo-Hookean material is applied. Relaxation is also applied before all loading
processes. The plain strain condition is considered. The neural network is built up by the TensorFlow 2 library in Python. The ADAM
optimiser is selected with a learning rate of 1 × 10−5. All the problems are modelled on a 12th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-12490F
CPU (3.0 GHz) and with a Geforce 4060 Ti GPU.

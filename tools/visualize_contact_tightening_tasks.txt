Plotly HTML Viewer Tasks (GPU/WebGL)

Goal
- Generate a single HTML viewer that renders solid parts, contact pairs, and nut tightening animation
- Use Plotly WebGL (Mesh3d) for GPU-accelerated display in the browser

Task List
1) Design data flow
   - Load config.yaml and mir.cdb using existing parsers
   - Build solid meshes (all parts), contact surface meshes (per pair), and nut meshes
   - Decide on default decimation/triangle caps for browser performance

2) Implement Plotly HTML generator
   - New script: tools/visualize_contact_tightening_plotly.py (or add --html to existing script)
   - Create Mesh3d traces for:
     - base solids (low alpha)
     - bolts (medium alpha)
     - nuts (high alpha, animated)
     - master/slave contact surfaces (high contrast)
   - Precompute animation frames by rotating nut vertices around axis
   - Add slider and play controls for tightening frames

3) Contact pair selection UI
   - Build dropdown to select a single contact pair
   - Toggle visibility: only the selected pair is highlighted
   - Optional: "All pairs" view
   - Optional: update camera to focus on selected pair bounds

4) Output and metadata
   - Write results/contact_viewer.html
   - Write results/contact_viewer_meta.json (axes, centers, pair names)
   - Keep filenames short and ASCII-only

5) Validation
   - Open HTML in a browser and verify:
     - Solids render as closed surfaces
     - One contact pair highlights clearly
     - Nuts rotate in the correct direction around computed axes
   - Confirm performance: no major lag for default decimation

Notes
- If Plotly is missing, install it (pip install plotly)
- Avoid heavy geometry: use caps for triangles and prefer simplified meshes
